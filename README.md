# Installation-Shell-Script

This is a shell script to auto install some applications. You can use this script such as you're just finished up formatting your pc and wants to reinstall some programming applications back.

**Note**: This is just for linux, and depending of your linux's version or type, these commands may vary, but, you can still download this script and just commnent the unusable code for you, and descomment the code you'll use for.

**Commands for packman packages comming :)**

## How to use it?

To run this script you have to, first of all, go to the folder where is it, for example, if it is in dowloands in a folder called installation-shell-script, and supposing that you're at the home folder in your terminal, you can try out:

```bash 
  
  cd Downloads/installation-shell-script/

```

Or you can still try entering in the folder where it is your script, click in there with the right button mouse, and choose "open in terminal", if your linux support this option, of course.

And then, just typing in your terminal to execute it:

```bash

  ./installation-shell-script.sh

```

**Pay attetion!** 

When you get in the final part, which is the LAMP installation, you really have to pay attetion because of the Apache and MySQL will ask the server type and a password.

If you didn't understood or something went wrong in this final installation, I will leave you two sites, both are explaning about LAMP and how to install it, but one is in english and the other one in portugues, just for you to choose the best one for you, my pal :)
