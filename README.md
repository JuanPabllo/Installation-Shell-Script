## How to use it?

To run this script you have to, first of all, go to the folder where is it, for example, if it is in dowloands in a folder called installation-shell-script, and supposing that you're at the home folder in your terminal, you can try out:

```bash 
  
  cd Downloads/installation-shell-script/

```

Or you can still try entering in the folder where it is your script, click in there with the right button mouse, and choose "open in terminal", if your linux support this option, of course.

And then, just typing in your terminal to execute it:

```bash

  ./installation-shell-script.sh
